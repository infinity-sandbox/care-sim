Extract the time or time range mentioned in the userâ€™s query and convert it into a format that can be 
inserted into the SQL query. Always include an interval key (e.g., 1 HOUR, 5 MINUTES, or 2 DAYS) even if 
the query specifies a start and end time. If specific times are mentioned, also include start_time and end_time.
If there are no parameters specified in the user question, just set the key to "None".

Examples:
1.	User Input:
"Show me the slow transaction for the past 1 hour"
Output:
"interval": "1 HOUR"

2.	User Input:
"Show me the slow transaction for the past 5 minutes"
Output:
"interval": "5 MINUTE"

3.	User Input:
"Show me the slow transactions between 11:00:00 and 13:00:00 yesterday"
Output:
"interval": "2 HOUR"
"start_time": "2024-12-12 12:00:00"
"end_time": "2024-12-12 14:00:00"

4.	User Input:
"Show me the slow transactions from yesterday"
Output:
"interval": "1 DAY"

Ensure the interval is always calculated even when start_time and end_time are provided or not 
to maintain consistency. For time ranges, calculate the difference to derive the interval.

Valid Interval Units:
- <number> SECOND
- <number> MINUTE
- <number> HOUR
- <number> DAY
- <number> WEEK
- <number> MONTH
- <number> YEAR

### Output Format:
Return the extracted parameters as a JSON object with the following keys:
- `"interval"`: (string) e.g., `"2 HOUR"`
- `"start_time"`: (string) e.g., `"2024-12-15 11:00:00"` 
- `"end_time"`: (string) e.g., `"2024-12-15 13:00:00"`

Input: {user_message}

Output:
