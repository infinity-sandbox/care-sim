I am building a day care center ai simulator page where a client (the day care center) can fill out the steps
(forms) to get insight from llm day-care about their finances, how many people they can hire, and other things.
i am using react with typescript and antd for design.

the front end has accent color of blue and background color of white.
what i want you to do is to create a react page that has a form with multiple steps
that will collect information from the user and then send it to the backend to get insight from llm day-care.
so the final result is a dashboard from the llm that can show Insights
also i want to use axios as the http client to send and recive data so put a sample axios call to the backend to get the insights.
but for now you can just put a placeholder for the axios call. (and you can use dummy data for now but comment on it that what i should place a data from the axios endpoint so that i can replace it latter)
I want the full code (don't say you can finish it at random place), I want the full functionality.
It should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

so when building the frontend you should know and use what kinds of data i am expecting from the backend and what kind of data i will send to the backend. (that's how to build the frontend and backend together) (basicly the data must be a structured json response).


all files must be in there respective folder and file names (css files in styles/ folder, components in components/ folder, etc.). make it all structured and organized.


this is my already started folder structure that i have built and i am buildinig this from this standpoint:
- login page (after the login it should land on the welcome page)

the form should have the following fields:

this should be included:
- the front end has accent color of blue and background color of white.
- a welcome message that describes the application (at the start of the page) then it will land
on the form page with steps 
- the form should have multiple steps to collect information from the user
- the form should have a save button and a next button (when i hit back it will show the saved data: you can save this in the frontend side)
- the form should have a hidden side bar with logout option (at the right top cornor which has the first letter of the email loged in(you can put endpoint to give you this))
- make it proffesional and usable in real world our there for deployment
- make it elegant and beautiful with nice fonts and orders
- will have buttons to add more if the client has more info to put
- and it must have info pop out on each section to descript what they can fill there
- and finally it should have insight button after step 1 is finished and insight will load and wait for llm response



so my boss send me a sample frontend, I will copy the lables from the image only the texts of the filed and steps (so it might be some how the text and lables might not be organized since i copied the raw text from the image so try to understand it)
